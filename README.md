Prediction of speeds in Manhattan, and fragility of transportation network to collisions
How fragile and how predictable are city transportation networks?

With internet connected vehicles on the rise, new problems arise such as large-scale hacks/ software malfunction

Through NYC open access data, I've analyzed how predictable traffic speeds are in the year of 2018 based on:

1) Location of detector
2) Time of day
3) Day of week
4) Rate of collisions / hour

I get r^2 for predictions=0.72 taking collision rate into account, but only 0.65 withough collisions
